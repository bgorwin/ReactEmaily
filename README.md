# ReactEmaily

This project is going to use the Stack React, Redux, Express and MongoDB to build a email based software that will allow a company to collect users emails
and send out promotional offer, updates on anything new within the company to their users, such as a newsletter and be able to 
receive emails back from users with any questions.
